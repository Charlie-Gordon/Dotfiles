#+TITLE: dotfiles

To be honest, it's mostly just Emacs. Some of the Emacs packages I use
require a more involved installation, namely, [[https://github.com/vedang/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] and [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][org-roam]].
Be sure to read their respective README for instructions.

* Installation

I use a [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]] (Yet Another Dotfiles Manager) to manage my dotfiles, if
your're using it, just
#+begin_example
yadm clone https://gitlab.com/Charlie-Gordon/dotfiles.git
#+end_example
Otherwise you can copy individual files or directories to your $HOME, thanks!
