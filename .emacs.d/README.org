#+TITLE: A fairly reasonable Emacs config
This is my emacs configuration tree structure like Steve Purcell's [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][emacs.d]]
I stole some code from there and from Protesilaos Stavrou's [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/][dotemacs]] as well.
Here're some explanation for my configuration
#+begin_example
.emacs.d
 |
 `- external/ contains files related to other programs
 `- lisp/ loads on initialize time, contains all of my configuration
 `- org-template/ contains org-capture templates, for my note-taking
 `- site-lisp/ contains third-party packages or configuration, more on its README.
 `- early-init.el sets things up before Emacs starts, removing some UI elements mostly.
 `- init.el loads all the configuration in lisp/, and some packages that require little configuration.
